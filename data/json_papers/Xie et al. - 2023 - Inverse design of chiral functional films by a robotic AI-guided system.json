    "Abstract": "Chiral functional films with large dissymmetry factors (g-factors) are highly desired for advanced optical and optoelectronic applications. However, the development of such materials is challenged by the immense design space and complex structure–property relationships. Here, we report an artificial intelligence (AI)-guided robotic system for the inverse design of chiral functional films. By integrating a mobile robot, an automated synthesis and characterization platform, and a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm, the system autonomously explores the chemical space of chiral films. We demonstrate the capability of this system by optimizing the g-factor of chiral films composed of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives and binphthyl enantiomers. The AI-guided robot successfully identified a chiral film with a record-high g-factor of 0.23 within 6 weeks, which is significantly faster than human researchers. Furthermore, the system revealed the key factors governing the chiral amplification in the film formation process. This work not only provides a powerful tool for the accelerated discovery of chiral materials but also demonstrates the potential of AI-guided robotics in materials science.",
    "Introduction": "Chirality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays a vital role in biological systems and life activities. In recent years, chiral functional materials have attracted increasing attention due to their potential applications in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), enantioselective sensing, and spintronics. Among them, chiral films based on supramolecular assembly are particularly promising because of their tunable chiroptical properties and ease of processing. The chiroptical activity of these films is usually evaluated by the dissymmetry factor (g-factor), which is defined as g = 2(AL - AR)/(AL + AR), where AL and AR are the absorbance of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. However, most reported chiral films exhibit low g-factors (typically <0.05), limiting their practical applications. Constructing chiral films with high g-factors remains a significant challenge due to the lack of understanding of the complex relationships between molecular structures, assembly conditions, and chiroptical properties. The vast chemical space and the intricate interplay of various factors make the traditional trial-and-error approach inefficient and time-consuming. Recently, data-driven approaches combined with laboratory automation have emerged as a powerful paradigm for accelerating materials discovery. By closing the loop of design, synthesis, characterization, and data analysis, self-driving laboratories can autonomously explore the design space and identify optimal materials with desired properties. Herein, we present an AI-guided robotic system for the inverse design of chiral functional films. The system integrates a mobile robot, an automated synthesis and characterization platform, and a machine learning algorithm. We chose the self-assembly of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives and binaphthyl enantiomers as a model system to demonstrate the capability of our platform.",
    "Results": "The AI-guided robotic system consists of a mobile robot (armed with a collaborative robotic arm), an automated liquid handling station, a spin-coater, a hotplate, and a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer (Fig. 1). The mobile robot acts as a courier, transporting samples between different stations. The liquid handling station performs the preparation of precursor solutions and the mixing of chiral and achiral components. The spin-coater and hotplate are used for film fabrication and thermal annealing, respectively. The CD spectrometer is employed to characterize the chiroptical properties of the films. The entire workflow is orchestrated by a central control software, which coordinates the actions of the hardware modules and manages the data flow. The brain of the system is a BO algorithm, which iteratively updates the surrogate model based on the experimental feedback and suggests the next batch of experiments to maximize the g-factor. To validate the performance of our system, we focused on the optimization of chiral films formed by the co-assembly of an achiral PDI derivative (PDI-1) and a chiral binaphthyl dopant (R-1 or S-1). The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 2. We selected four experimental variables for optimization: the concentration of PDI-1, the molar ratio of dopant to PDI-1, the spin-coating speed, and the annealing temperature. The objective was to maximize the absolute value of the g-factor at the characteristic absorption band of PDI aggregates. The optimization process started with a random initialization of 10 experiments. Then, the BO algorithm took over and iteratively guided the robot to explore the design space. Fig. 2a shows the evolution of the maximum g-factor as a function of the number of experiments. It can be seen that the g-factor increased rapidly in the first few iterations and reached a plateau after about 50 experiments. The robot successfully identified a champion film with a g-factor of -0.23, which is the highest value reported for PDI-based chiral films to date. In contrast, a random search strategy with the same number of experiments only yielded a maximum g-factor of -0.08. We also compared the efficiency of the robot with human researchers. It took the robot about 6 weeks to complete 100 experiments, while a human researcher would typically need several months to achieve the same amount of work, considering the time for data analysis and experiment planning. The high efficiency of the robotic system is attributed to its 24/7 continuous operation and the intelligent sampling strategy of the BO algorithm.",
    "Discussion": "To understand the mechanism underlying the high g-factor, we analyzed the experimental data collected by the robot. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of g-factors in the parameter space. We found that high g-factors are concentrated in a specific region defined by a moderate PDI concentration, a high dopant ratio, a low spin-coating speed, and a high annealing temperature. This suggests that the formation of highly dissymmetric structures requires a delicate balance between the aggregation rate and the chiral induction efficiency. We further characterized the morphology and molecular packing of the optimal film using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The AFM images (Fig. 4) revealed that the film consists of interconnected nanofibers with a helical twist. The XRD patterns indicated a highly ordered lamellar packing of PDI molecules. Based on these observations, we propose a mechanism for the chiral amplification in the film formation process. The chiral dopant induces a slight twist in the PDI stacks during the initial nucleation stage. This chiral bias is then amplified during the subsequent growth and annealing processes, leading to the formation of long-range ordered helical structures with strong chiroptical activity. The BO algorithm effectively navigated the complex energy landscape to find the optimal conditions for this chiral amplification. Our results demonstrate that AI-guided robotics can not only accelerate the discovery of new materials but also provide physical insights into the structure–property relationships.",
    "Materials and Methods": "Materials: PDI-1 was synthesized according to literature procedures. R-1 and S-1 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents were of analytical grade and used as received. Robotic System: The mobile robot (MiR100) was equipped with a UR5 robotic arm (Universal Robots) and a gripper (Robotiq). The liquid handling station (Opentrons OT-2) was used for solution preparation. The spin-coater (Laurell) and hotplate (Thermo Fisher) were integrated into the workflow for film fabrication. Characterization: CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-1500 spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. AFM images were obtained using a Bruker Dimension Icon microscope. XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer. Algorithm: The BO algorithm was implemented using the BoTorch library in Python. Gaussian process regression was used as the surrogate model, and the expected improvement (EI) acquisition function was used to select the next experiments."
