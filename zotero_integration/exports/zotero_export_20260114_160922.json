      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Useful materials must satisfy multiple objectives, where the optimization of one objective is often at the expense of another. The Pareto front reports the optimal trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. Here we use a self-driving laboratory, Ada, to define the Pareto front of conductivities and processing temperatures for palladium films formed by combustion synthesis. Ada discovers new synthesis conditions that yield metallic films at lower processing temperatures (below 200 °C) relative to the prior art for this technique (250 °C). This temperature difference makes possible the coating of different commodity plastic materials (e.g., Nafion, polyethersulfone). These combustion synthesis conditions enable us to to spray coat uniform palladium films with moderate conductivity (1.1 × 10\n              5\n               S m\n              −1\n              ) at 191 °C. Spray coating at 226 °C yields films with conductivities (2.0 × 10\n              6\n               S m\n              −1\n              ) comparable to those of sputtered films (2.0 to 5.8 × 10\n              6\n               S m\n              −1\n              ). This work shows how a self-driving laboratoy can discover materials that provide optimal trade-offs between conflicting objectives.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Increasing complexity of modern laser systems, mostly originated from the nonlinear dynamics of radiation, makes control of their operation more and more challenging, calling for development of new approaches in laser engineering. Machine learning methods, providing proven tools for identification, control, and data analytics of various complex systems, have been recently applied to mode-locked fiber lasers with the special focus on three key areas: self-starting, system optimization and characterization. However, the development of the machine learning algorithms for a particular laser system, while being an interesting research problem, is a demanding task requiring arduous efforts and tuning a large number of hyper-parameters in the laboratory arrangements. It is not obvious that this learning can be smoothly transferred to systems that differ from the specific laser used for the algorithm development by design or by varying environmental parameters. Here we demonstrate that a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, based on trials and errors and sequential decisions, can be successfully used for control of the generation of dissipative solitons in mode-locked fiber laser system. We have shown the capability of deep Q-learning algorithm to generalize knowledge about the laser system in order to find conditions for stable pulse generation. Region of stable generation was transformed by changing the pumping power of the laser cavity, while tunable spectral filter was used as a control tool. Deep Q-learning algorithm is suited to learn the trajectory of adjusting spectral filter parameters to stable pulsed regime relying on the state of output radiation. Our results confirm the potential of deep reinforcement learning algorithm to control a nonlinear laser system with a feed-back. We also demonstrate that fiber mode-locked laser systems generating data at high speed present a fruitful photonic test-beds for various machine learning concepts based on large datasets.",

This platform uses computations, historical data from the literature, machine learning (ML) and active learning to plan and interpret the outcomes of experiments performed using robotics. Over 17 days of continuous operation, the A-Lab realized 41 novel compounds from a set of 58 targets including a variety of oxides and phosphates that were identified using large-scale ab initio phase-stability data from the Materials Project and Google DeepMind. Synthesis recipes were proposed by natural-language models trained on the literature and optimized using an active-learning approach grounded in thermodynamics. Analysis of the failed syntheses provides direct and actionable suggestions to improve current techniques for materials screening and synthesis design. The high success rate demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-driven platforms for autonomous materials discovery and motivates further integration of computations, historical knowledge and robotics.",

We report the Fast Autonomous Scanning Toolkit (FAST) that addresses this challenge by combining a neural network, route optimization, and efficient hardware controls to enable a self-driving experiment that actively identifies and measures a sparse but representative data subset in lieu of the full dataset. FAST requires no prior information about the sample, is computationally efficient, and uses generic hardware controls with minimal experiment-specific wrapping. We test FAST in simulations and a dark-field X-ray microscopy experiment of a WSe\n              2\n              film. Our studies show that a FAST scan of <25% is sufficient to accurately image and analyze the sample.

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Artificial chiral materials and nanostructures with strong and tuneable chiroptical activities, including sign, magnitude, and wavelength distribution, are useful owing to their potential applications in chiral sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and chiroptical devices. Thus, the inverse design and customized manufacturing of these materials is highly desirable. Here, we use an artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic chemist to accurately predict chiroptical activities from the experimental absorption spectra and structure/process parameters, and generate chiral films with targeted chiroptical activities across the full visible spectrum. The robotic AI-chemist carries out the entire process, including chiral film construction, characterization, and testing. A machine learned reverse design model using spectrum embedded descriptors is developed to predict optimal structure/process parameters for any targeted chiroptical property. A series of chiral films with a dissymmetry factor as high as 1.9 (\n              g\n              abs\n               ~ 1.9) are identified out of more than 100 million possible structures, and their feasible application in circular polarization-selective color filters for multiplex laser display and switchable circularly polarized (CP) luminescence is demonstrated. Our findings not only provide chiral films with the highest reported chiroptical activity, but also have great fundamental value for the inverse design of chiroptical materials.",

This study demonstrates the concept of self-adjusting optical systems and presents a new approach based on reinforcement learning methods. We integrated reinforcement learning algorithms into the setup for tuning the laser radiation into the fiber, as well as into the complex for controlling the laser-plasma source. That reduced the dispersion of the generated X-ray signal by 2–3 times through automatic adjustment of the position of the rotating copper target and completely eliminated the linear trend arising from the ablation of the target surface. The adjustment of the system was performed based on feedback signals obtained from the spectrometer, and the movement of the target was achieved using a neural network-controlled stepper motor. As feedback, the second harmonic of femtosecond laser radiation was used, the intensity of which has a square root dependence on the X-ray yield. The developed machine learning methodology allows the considered systems to optimize their performance and adapt in real time, leading to increased efficiency, accuracy, and reliability.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous methods to align beamlines can decrease the amount of time spent on diagnostics, and also uncover better global optima leading to better beam quality. The alignment of these beamlines is a high-dimensional expensive-to-sample optimization problem involving the simultaneous treatment of many optical elements with correlated and nonlinear dynamics. Bayesian optimization is a strategy of efficient global optimization that has proved successful in similar regimes in a wide variety of beamline alignment applications, though it has typically been implemented for particular beamlines and optimization tasks. In this paper, we present a basic formulation of Bayesian inference and Gaussian process models as they relate to multi-objective Bayesian optimization, as well as the practical challenges presented by beamline alignment. We show that the same general implementation of Bayesian optimization with special consideration for beamline alignment can quickly learn the dynamics of particular beamlines in an online fashion through hyperparameter fitting with no prior information. We present the implementation of a concise software framework for beamline alignment and test it on four different optimization problems for experiments on X-ray beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source II and the Advanced Light Source, and an electron beam at the Accelerator Test Facility, along with benchmarking on a simulated digital twin. We discuss new applications of the framework, and the potential for a unified approach to beamline alignment at synchrotron facilities.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            With the rise of self-driving labs (SDLs) and automated experimentation across chemical and materials sciences, there is a considerable challenge in designing the best autonomous lab for a given problem based on published studies alone. Determining what digital and physical features are germane to a specific study is a critical aspect of SDL design that needs to be approached quantitatively. Even when controlling for features such as dimensionality, every experimental space has unique requirements and challenges that influence the design of the optimal physical platform and algorithm. Metrics such as optimization rate are therefore not necessarily indicative of the capabilities of an SDL across different studies. In this perspective, we highlight some of the critical metrics for quantifying performance in SDLs to better guide researchers in implementing the most suitable strategies. We then provide a brief review of the existing literature under the lens of quantified performance as well as heuristic recommendations for platform and experimental space pairings.",

However, traditional microscopes and autofocus methods face hardware limitations and slow software speeds in achieving this goal. In response, this paper proposes the implementation of an adaptive Liquid Lens Microscope System utilizing Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Autofocus (DRLAF). The proposed study employs a custom-made liquid lens with a rapid zoom response, which is treated as an “agent.” Raw images are utilized as the “state”, with voltage adjustments representing the “actions.” Deep reinforcement learning is employed to learn the focusing strategy directly from captured images, achieving end-to-end autofocus. In contrast to methodologies that rely exclusively on sharpness assessment as a model’s labels or inputs, our approach involved the development of a targeted reward function, which has proven to markedly enhance the performance in microscope autofocus tasks. We explored various action group design methods and improved the microscope autofocus speed to an average of 3.15 time steps. Additionally, parallel “state” dataset lists with random sampling training are proposed which enhances the model’s adaptability to unknown samples, thereby improving its generalization capability. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens microscope with DRLAF exhibits high robustness, achieving a 79% increase in speed compared to traditional search algorithms, a 97.2% success rate, and enhanced generalization compared to other deep learning methods.",

      "abstractNote": "We successfully demonstrated an intelligent adaptive beam alignment scheme using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm integrated with an 8 × 8 photonic array antenna operating in the 40 GHz millimeter wave (MMW) band. In our proposed scheme, the three key elements of RL: state, action, and reward, are represented as the phase values in the photonic array antenna, phase changes with specified steps, and an obtained error vector magnitude (EVM) value, respectively. Furthermore, thanks to the Q-table, the RL agent can effectively choose the most suitable action based on its prior experiences. As a result, the proposed scheme autonomously achieves the best EVM performance by determining the optimal phase. In this Letter, we verify the capability of the proposed scheme in single- and multiple-user scenarios and experimentally demonstrate the performance of beam alignment to the user’s location optimized by the RL algorithm. The achieved results always meet the signal quality requirement specified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) criterion for 64-QAM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).",

To overcome these limitations, data‐driven microscopes incorporate feedback loops between data acquisition and analysis. This review overviews how machine learning enables automated image analysis to optimise microscopy in real time. We first introduce key data‐driven microscopy concepts and machine learning methods relevant to microscopy image analysis. Subsequently, we highlight pioneering works and recent advances in integrating machine learning into microscopy acquisition workflows, including optimising illumination, switching modalities and acquisition rates, and triggering targeted experiments. We then discuss the remaining challenges and future outlook. Overall, intelligent microscopes that can sense, analyse and adapt promise to transform optical imaging by opening new experimental possibilities.",

A critical component of SDLs is the decision-making algorithm used to prioritize experiments to be performed. This SDL “brain” often relies on optimization strategies that are guided by machine learning models, such as Bayesian optimization. However, the diversity of hardware constraints and scientific questions being tackled by SDLs require the availability of a set of flexible algorithms that have yet to be implemented in a single software tool. Here, we report Atlas, an application-agnostic Python library for Bayesian optimization that is specifically tailored to the needs of SDLs. Atlas provides facile access to state-of-the-art, model-based optimization algorithms—including mixed-parameter, multi-objective, constrained, robust, multi-fidelity, meta-learning, asynchronous, and molecular optimization—as an all-in-one tool that is expected to suit the majority of specialized SDL needs. After a brief description of its core capabilities, we demonstrate Atlas' utility by optimizing the oxidation potential of metal complexes with an autonomous electrochemical experimentation platform. We expect Atlas to expand the breadth of design and discovery problems in the natural sciences that are immediately addressable with SDLs.",

By leveraging multi-objective bayesian optimization, the system continuously refines its performance, reducing optimization time and minimizing the need for manual adjustments.

      "abstractNote": "We propose a generalized reinforcement learning (RL) approach for personalized autofocus control in wafer micro-imaging, aiming to address the issue of inconsistent focal distances across different wafer regions. Our method integrates region selection with focus control by creating a deep network that estimates focal distances based on the current image frame. Through multiple rounds of image capture and evaluation in the RL framework, the network is fine-tuned to develop personalized models that predict optimal focal distances for interest regions based on engineer feedback. The Gaussian policy gradient algorithm is used to update the model's policy network during the fine-tuning process. To validate our approach, we constructed a dataset of wafer images captured at varying focal distances for training and prediction. Experimental results show that our network not only resolves the limited generalization of focus adjustment algorithms across regions but also achieves an average improvement of approximately 4.0% in focusing quality. This method eliminates the need for manual focus adjustment and region selection in wafer inspection, offering new insights for improving wafer micro-imaging quality.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Optimised alignment is important in optical systems, particularly in high-precision instrumentation such as gravitational wave detectors, in order to maximise the sensitivity. During operations, high performing optical wave-front sensing and feedback systems are used to maintain optical cavity performance. However, the need for an automated initial alignment process arises after maintenance or large environmental disturbances such as earthquakes, as it can be challenging to manually achieve optimised as well as consistent optical alignments. In this study, a machine learning control system is presented to determine the optimal input beam alignment of an optical cavity based on a digital camera stream of the transmitted cavity mode. We use convolutional neural networks to classify the cavity mode from its image, with 100% prediction accuracy for the desired mode. A genetic algorithm is applied to find experimental parameters that maximise the transmitted power of a chosen cavity mode. The system demonstrates consistent alignment outcomes that the median intensity over multiple trials exceeds 95% by the sixth generation of the algorithm. These results show that machine learning techniques can be implemented to automate the alignment process that is compatible for a broad range of optical resonator platforms.",

An example of a task that is often laborious is the alignment of a high-finesse optical resonator, which is highly sensitive to the mode of the input beam. In this work, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to achieve autonomous mode-matching of a free-space optical resonator with minimal supervision. Our approach leverages sample-efficient algorithms to reduce data requirements while maintaining a simple architecture for easy deployment. The reinforcement learning scheme that we have developed shows that automation is feasible even in systems prone to drift in experimental parameters, as may well be the case in real-world applications.",

Most methods of aligning aberration correctors require specialized sample regions and are unsuitable for fine-tuning aberrations without interrupting on-going experiments. Here, we present an automated method of correcting first- and second-order aberrations called BEACON, which uses Bayesian optimization of the normalized image variance to efficiently determine the optimal corrector settings. We demonstrate its use on gold nanoparticles and a hafnium dioxide thin film showing its versatility in nano- and atomic-scale experiments. BEACON can correct all first- and second-order aberrations simultaneously to achieve an initial alignment and first- and second-order aberrations independently for fine alignment. Ptychographic reconstructions are used to demonstrate an improvement in probe shape and a reduction in the target aberration.",

Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrates up to a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 74° field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.",
